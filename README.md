## Practice Datasets
Note: The representation of decimal numbers varies across countries, and there are two main conventions: the comma (“,”) and the dot (“.”) as the decimal separator. That’s why I’ve prepared the files for both cases, if you are located in European country then download EU files otherwise download Non-EU Files. If for some reason you are having problems with the [CSV file] – post a question in the course.
